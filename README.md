# Installation
Anaconda distribution of Python + prettytable library

# Project Motivation
For this project, I was interestested in using Open Sourcing Mental Illness (OSMI) data from 2016 to better understand:
  - Does work remotely reduce the chance of having a mental disorder in the tech workplace?
  - Is getting older make you more vulnerable to mental health issues?
  - Who are more open to discuss their mental health condition (Males vs Females)?

# File Descriptions
There is 1 notebook available here to showcase work related to the above questions, it is exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions showcased by the notebook title. Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.

# Results
The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@hasanshhaa/interesting-mental-health-insights-for-tech-workers-89f9913d20a4)
